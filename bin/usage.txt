Usage: replicate-couchdb-cluster -s source -t target options

  -s source           The URL for the CouchDB cluster from which we will be
                      replicating

  -t target           The URL for the CouchDB cluster to which we will be
                      replicating

Options:

  -c max-concurrency  The maximum number of concurrent replications. If this
                      value is omitted then the max-concurrency is defaulted
                      to 20.

  -i dbs-to-skip      A comma separated list of DBS to skip

  -a                  Use the target's _replicate API when replicating. This is
                      particularly useful when you are trying to replicate from
                      a remote source to localhost. By default, the source's
                      _replicate API is used.

  -v                  Verbose

  -d                  Debug info such as details of the requests and responses.
                      Useful for determining why long replications are failing.

Examples:

  Replicate all DBs on example1.com to example2.com:

    $ replicate-couchdb-cluster -s http://example1.com:5984 -t http://example2.com:5984

  Replicate all DBs, except the _users and _replicator DBs:

    $ replicate-couchdb-cluster -s http://example1.com:5984 -t http://example2.com:5984 \
                                -i _users,replicator

  Replicate all DBs using SSL and authentication:

    $ replicate-couchdb-cluster -s https://admin1:secrect1@example1.com:6984 \
                                -t https://admin2:secrect2@example2.com:6984

  Replicate all DBs from a remote source to a local source:

    $ replicate-couchdb-cluster -s https://admin1:secrect1@example1.com \
                                -t http://localhost:5984
                                -a
